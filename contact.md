## Contact Information
					
Email is definitely the best way to reach me. If I don't respond within the day, I'm probably dead. I can be reached at either of the following email addresses:

- adam {dot} liter {at} gmail {dot} com
- literada {at} msu {dot} edu

Also, I [recently started using a new OpenPGP key][PGPTransition]. You can download the key from a server with:

    gpg --keyserver keys.riseup.net --recv-key '0x98723a2089026cd6'

or you can get a copy of the key [here][NewKey].

Laslty, other places you can find me on the internet include:

- [Facebook][facebook]
- [Twitter][twitter]
- [TeX.SX][tex-sx]
