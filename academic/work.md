			<dt>acquisition of syntax of passives</dt>
			<dd class="smaller">This project is aimed at rigorously exploring the acquisition facts of all types of <span style="font-style:italic;">be</span>- and <span style="font-style:italic;">get</span>-passives with the hope that these facts will be able to weigh in on the debates about the syntax thereof.</dd>
			<dt>number &amp; nouns; (non)frequency effects in learning</dt>
			<dd class="smaller">This is a continuation of the project&#8212;an artificial language learning experiment&#8212;that gave birth to the two presentations below. The two main questions of this project are (i) whether number systems constrain semantic interpretations of nouns and (ii) whether&#8212;or, perhaps, how&#8212;inconsistency of a grammatical feature in a learning input affects the acquisition thereof.</dd>

	<h4>
	Current Work:
	</h4>
	<p class="smaller">Currently, much of my focus is on my work in linguistics. Nonetheless, there are three things that I have been intermittently working on lately.</p>
	<dl>
		<dt>(animal) ethics methodologies</dt>
		<dd class="smaller">This is the most developed of the three (and even has a manuscript; email if you're interested). In brief, I argue that the methodological landscape is relatively barren for being able to successfully underwrite animal ethics claims. Importantly, this is not intended to undercut those claims; it's a call for methodological diversification, if anything.</dd>
		<dt>the nature of propositions</dt>
		<dd class="smaller">Specifically, I'm far from convinced that all of the things propositions are supposed to do across varying (sub)disciplines is even possible, and I'm also suspicious of propositions being abstract objects. I'm attempting to start with a linguistically-informed account of propositions and work my way outward.</dd>
		<dt>the nature of the <span style="font-style:italic;">a priori</span></dt>
		<dd class="smaller">This is the least developed. In brief, I think the concept of <span style="font-style:italic;">a priority</span> is philosophically/metaphysically reducible.</dd>
