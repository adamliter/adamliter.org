## Linguistic interests

My main research interests in linguistics include syntax, semantics, their interface, architectural issues more broadly, and child language acquisition. In particular, I have recently been investigating the syntax and acquisition of passive constructions, a possible restriction in the available interpretations for number morphology that a grammar might impose on the semantics, and the syntax to phonology mapping.

## What is linguistics

If you're not a linguist then, in all likelihood, none of that made sense. If you're just wondering what linguistics is, generally, well, here's a shot at explaining it.

Linguistics is the scientific study of human language. Linguists attempt to figure out what it is that you know when you know a language, how that knowledge is acquired, and how it is put to use.[^1] Attempts to answer the first question are perhaps most pervasive in the field of linguistics, so I will focus on that question.

Knowledge of a particular language is constituted by many things. Knowing a language involves knowing how---and how not---to put words together into sentences (syntax), how---and how not---to put words together (morphology),[^2] how---and how not---to externalize those linguistic objects, either via speeh or signing (phonology), and how---and how not---to interpret them (semantics). Often, knowing what is __not__ linguistically possible is just as useful as knowing what __is__ linguistically possible for determining how language works. 

There are, nonetheless, many other subfields of linguistics that attempt to solve other parts of the puzzle, including child language acquisition (how is language acquired), phonetics (how do the physical processes of language externalization actually work), historical linguistics (how and why do particular languages change over time), sociolinguistics and psycholinguistics (how is language used), neurolinguistics (how is language instantiated in the brain), and computational linguistics (how can natural languages be modeled).

It might also be worth mentioning what linguistics is not. Linguistics is __not__ about learning different languages.[^3] We tend to use the term _language_ to mean the biological system that allows humans to speak and comprehend languages. We also often use terms like _grammar_ and _faculty of language_ to be roughly interchangeable with _language_. So when we say we study language, we do __not__ mean that we study language<strong>s</strong>.

Linguistics is also __not__ about spelling or any other prescriptivist "grammar" rules that you may have learned in school. Orthographic systems are technological inventions that postdate the emergence of human language. They are technological inventions that are used to encode languages, but they have absolutely nothing to do with the nature of language, the biological system. Similarly, some of the "grammar" rules that are learned in school are not accurate representations of the ways that people actually speak. Many of these [are just rules that describe the dialect of upper-class, white privileged folks][squires]. And some of them don't even describe that dialect, such as the rule prohibiting split infinitives or the rule banning sentence-final prepositions. That is, even those who speak "standard English" split infinitives and end sentnecs in prepositions.

As scientists, we're interested in how the world actually is---*i.e.*, how speakers actually speak---and in figuring out why the world is that way. So prescriptivism is a bunch of bullshit that we don't put up with.[^4]

## Philosophical interests

As an undergraduate, I also studied philosophy. My main philosophical interests then (some of which I still ocassionally pursue) include, in no particular order, epistemology, feminist philosophy---especially feminist epistemology---, philosophy of language, environmental philosophy, logic, and metalogic.

## Notes

[^1]: My research interests fall mostly in the first category, though, as noted, I am also interested in child language acquisition to some extent.
[^2]: It is not the case that words are the smallest linguistic unit. Words can often be broken down into what linguists call morphemes. One morpheme that is smaller than a word is the English plural morpheme, -_s_.
[^3]: If you want to annoy a linguist, ask them how many languages they speak.
[^4]: This sentence is a variant of the infamous [Winston Churchill sentence][churchill]. According to the prescriptivist rule, the "grammatical" version of this sentence would be _prescriptivism is a bunch of bullshit up with which we will not put_, which is certainly not an acceptable sentence in (standard) English.
