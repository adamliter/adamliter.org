I gave the first part of an impromptu two-part workshop introducing linguists to the typesetting software LaTeX at the <a href="https://lsa2015.uchicago.edu/">2015 Linguistic Institute</a>. The handout for the workshop, which I plan to periodically update, can be found <a href="https://bit.ly/latex-workshop">here</a>.
