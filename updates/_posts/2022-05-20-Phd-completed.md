I graduated with my PhD from the [Department of Linguistics](https://linguistics.umd.edu/) at [University of Maryland](https://umd.edu/). My dissertation, "Explorations in Diagnosing Competence and Performance Factors in Linguistic Inquiry", can be found [here](https://drum.lib.umd.edu/handle/1903/29000).
