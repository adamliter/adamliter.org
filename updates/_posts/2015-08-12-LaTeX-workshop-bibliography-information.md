Now that the <a href="https://lsa2015.uchicago.edu/">2015 Linguistic Institute</a> is over and I've had a bit of a chance to catch my breath, I've updated the <a href="https://bit.ly/latex-workshop">handout that I used for the LaTeX workshop</a> that I gave at the Institute to include information about bibliographies. I hope you will find this useful!
