## Linguistics Summaries

This is a [series of summaries](http://blog.adamliter.org/linguistics-summaries/) of some of the work in linguistics that I've read. This series is largely for my purposes, though I thought I would put them on the web in case they end up being useful to anyone else. Nonetheless, the main purpose of this series is as a memory aid for me, so it is possible&#8212;perhaps likely&#8212;that they might not be that helpful to others.

## LaTeX &amp; Semantics

I'm currently developing some macros for typesetting work in semantics (a subfield of linguistics). Documentation for the macros can be found [here](http://adamliter.org/content/LaTeX/macros/SemMacros/SemanticsMacros.pdf). I would greatly appreciate any comments, suggestions, feedback, and/or improvements. I hope to package these macros up sometime in the future.
			
## Obligatory Conglomeration of Links

On [this page](http://misc.adamliter.org/links/), you will find links to places on the web that I enjoy and/or find useful.
