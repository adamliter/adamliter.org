## Spoken Word That I Procrastinate To

This is a list of spoken word pieces that I (i) procrastinate to, (ii) would (or have) watch(ed) one, two, three, and even twenty-seven times, (iii) don't want to ever forget about, (iv) and/or might want to share with friends (and hence want to have some documentation of the name of the piece and/or a link to the piece).

The list is currently organized by the artist (specifically, by last name, unless the artist uses a stage name, like Guante, for example).[^1]

## Notes

[^1]: At some point in the future, I plan on also including an option to sort the pieces by topic. But that's a distant plan.
