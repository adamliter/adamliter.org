## Reading List

This reading list serves a few purposes. Primarily, it's a handy means for me to keep track of things that I want to read in addition to being a reminder to myself to (!actually) read them. I thought I would put it on the internet in case anyone is interested in knowing what I'm reading and would recommend reading.

Once finished, if I do a writeup of what I read that I feel like sharing, I'll add a link to either a blog post or a handout about that particular reading, if anyone is interested. Though, again, these will likely be primarily for my own benefit, should I wish to revisit that work in the future.

Things are organized (more or less) by topic and then alphabetically.
