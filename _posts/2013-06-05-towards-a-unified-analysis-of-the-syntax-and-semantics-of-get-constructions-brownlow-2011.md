#### Claims 

Brownlow, in his dissertation, argues for the following denotation for _get_:[^1]<sup>,</sup>[^2]

<p style="margin-left:3em">(1) ⟦get⟧ = λf_<s,t>_.λe.∃e'[f(e') & cause(e,e')]</p>
<p style="margin-left:3em">(2011:16)</p>

This is the same denotation that Pylkkänen (2008) advances for the functional head Cause, which she argues is necessarily bundled with Voice (or accusative little _v_)[^3] in the syntax, at least in English.[^4] Contra Pylkkänen (2008), though, Brownlow argues that _get_ is a counterexample to the bundling proposal. Specifically, Brownlow's claims are twofold: (i) that this is indeed the correct denotation for _get_; and (ii) that an external argument can project independently of _get_ in the syntax&mdash;_i.e._, Voice and Cause are not necessarily bundled in the syntax of English.

#### Arguments

First, a terminological note: Brownlow distinguishes between A-type and B-type _get_ constructions, (2) and (3), respectively:

<p style="margin-left:3em">(2) John got angry</p>
<p style="margin-left:3em">(3) Mary got John angry</p>
<p style="margin-left:3em">(2011:9)</p>

The latter clearly projects an Agent argument that is independent of the Theme argument of _get_/Cause,[^5] whereas the former, argues Brownlow, are ambiguous between two types of A-type _get_ constructions: "true A-type _get_ constructions" and "agentive A-type _get_ constructions" (40-41).[^6]

Now, given the two claims, Brownlow must, unsurprisingly, do two things.

First, in order to establish that this is, in fact, the denotation for _get_, Brownlow must show that all allowable complements of _get_ are uniform and able to functionally combine with _get_.[^7] Chapter 2 begins with adjectival complementation, and, following Adger & Ramchand (2003), Brownlow argues that _get_ takes a PredP complement. Thus, Brownlow must also show that the PP complements of _get_ (as in (4)) are actually PredPs (chapter 3) and that passive complementation (as in (5)) are also PredPs (chapter 5).

<p style="margin-left:3em">(4) John got on the roof</p>
<p style="margin-left:3em">(5) John got arrested</p>
<p style="margin-left:3em">(2011:9)</p>


Second, Brownlow must also show that three properties hold of the constructions under consideration in order to show that Voice is projected without also being bundled with Cause&mdash;namely, (i) that there is a causing event in the structure; (ii) that the matrix subject is not an external argument; and (iii) that there is no implicit external argument (26).

Finally, chapter 4 could be construed as fielding an objection to the proposed analysis. Specifically, this chapter is dedicated to the agentive A-type _get_ constructions, as they arguably constitute a problem on the proposed analysis for two reasons. First, since one DP bears two Θ-roles, the analysis putatively goes against a standard assumption of Minimalism.[^8] For example, in (6), at least on the agentive A-type interpretation, _John_ is both the Theme of the drying event and the Agent of the getting event:

<p style="margin-left:3em">(6) John got dry</p>
<p style="margin-left:3em">(2011:165)</p>

Second, given that the Agentive interpretation is possible&mdash;_i.e._, the interpretation where _John_ is the Agent of the getting event&mdash;one analysis of this construction could be that it projects Voice and Cause together. Thus, chapter 4 is dedicated to arguing that these functional heads are still projected separately in the syntax even in these constructions, the argument for which (purportedly) obviates the Θ-role concern.[^9]

Given such an outline of the dissertation, I will briefly review the details in that order, beginning with chapters 2, 3, and 5 and ending with chapter 4.

##### Chapter 2

Using various tests for agentivity and the presence of Cause, Brownlow demonstrates that _get_ constructions with AP complements&mdash;such as those in (2), repeated here&mdash;project Voice and Cause separately (see pp. 27-43 for the details).

<p style="margin-left:3em">(2) John got angry</p>

This supports the second claim of the dissertation; thus, the remainder of the chapter is dedicated to establishing that such a denotation for _get_ is correct. To do so, Brownlow demonstrates that an account of why _get_ can combine with certain adjectives and not others (_cf_. (2) and (7)) supports the denotation for _get_ on compositional grounds&mdash;_i.e._, the types fit together.

<p style="margin-left:3em">(7) *John got human</p>
<p style="margin-left:3em">(2011:44)</p>

First, Brownlow notes that _get_ seems to only combine with adjectives that are stage-level and not those that are individual-level, in the sense of Carlson (1977). Following Adger & Ramchand (2003), Brownlow explains the generalizations of Carlson (1977) in terms of a Pred projection in the syntax, of which there are two types:[^10]

<p style="margin-left:3em">(8) ⟦Pred⟧ = λπ.λx.λe.[holds(π,e) & Holder(e,x)]</p>
<p style="margin-left:3em">(9) ⟦Pred⟧ = λπ.λx[holds(π,x)]</p>
<p style="margin-left:3em">(2011:66)</p>

Specifically, the Pred in (8) accounts for stage-level adjectives because the _holds_ relation holds between a property and an eventuality and the _Holder_ relation then holds between that eventuality and an individual, thereby allowing a property to only be predicated of some stage of an individual. On the other hand, the Pred in (9) predicates some property directly of an individual, accounting for individual-level adjectives, since there is no mediating eventuality argument present in the derivation.[^11]

Now, since the proposed denotation for _get_ only combines with things of type <e,<s,t>>, then this analysis of _get_&mdash;at least on the assumption that this analysis of Carlson's (1977) generalizations about stages and individuals is correct&mdash;explains the data of _get_ constructions with adjectival complementation, thereby providing empirical support for the analysis.[^12]

##### Chapter 3

In this chapter, Brownlow addresses PP complementation of _get_. First again, however, a terminological note: Brownlow, following Zwarts (2005), distinguishes between locative prepositions (LocPs) and directional prepositions (DirPs), as in (10) and (11), respectively:

<p style="margin-left:3em">(10) The boy is on the table</p>
<p style="margin-left:3em">(11) The boy crawled onto the car</p>
<p style="margin-left:3em">(2011:69)</p>

In brief, the former pinpoint a location or position and the latter describe a path of movement. Then, Brownlow further distinguishes the DirPs on the basis of telicity&mdash;namely, as either telic, atelic, or telos ambiguous (70).

In terms of _get_ complementation, then, Brownlow notes that the generalizations are the following: (i) LocPs, telic DirPs, and telos ambiguous DirPs&mdash;but **not** atelic DirPs&mdash;can combine with _get_; (ii) _at _cannot combine with _get_; and (iii) telos ambiguous DirPs disambiguate in favor of telicity when they appear as the complement of _get_:

<p style="margin-left:3em">(12)</p>
<p style="margin-left:6em">a. LocPs</p>
<p style="margin-left:6em">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;John got on/beside/under the ladder</p>
<p style="margin-left:6em">b. Telic DirPs</p>
<p style="margin-left:6em">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;John got out of/into/in the theatre</p>
<p style="margin-left:6em">c. Atelic DirPs</p>
<p style="margin-left:6em">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*John got towards/along/from the river</p>
<p style="margin-left:6em">d. Telos Ambiguous DirPs</p>
<p style="margin-left:6em">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;John got across/over/through the river</p>
<p style="margin-left:6em">[note: the interpretation is necessarily telic—_i.e._, John necessarily successfully crossed the river if these sentences are true]</p>
<p style="margin-left:6em">e. <i>at</i></p>
<p style="margin-left:6em">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*John got at the river</p>
<p style="margin-left:3em">(2011:71)</p>

With terminology and empirical generalizations in hand, Brownlow again runs through several tests for agentivity and the presence of Cause, demonstrating that, so long as the denotation of _get_ is correct, it seems English can project Voice and Cause independently in the syntax (71-80).

After demonstrating that Voice and Cause project independently in these constructions, Brownlow begins with an analysis of LocP complementation of _get_ (82-87). He argues that LocPPs are properties relating a set of contiguous points i to some entity, which then combines with Pred, as in (13):[^13]

<p style="margin-left:3em">(13) <img style="vertical-align:text-top;"src="http://i.imgur.com/cqGW6fh.jpg" alt="brownlow2011-johnonroof" /></p>
<p style="margin-left:3em">(Brownlow 2011:85)</p>

This structure is then merged with _get_ and the derivation proceeds normally. Next, Brownlow develops an account of DirPs following Svenonius (2010), arguing that DirPs are compositionally built from LocPs and some _path_ head; Brownlow relies on Zwarts (2005) to account for these _path_ heads, of which there are three (102). Based on the _path_ head denotations, the DirPPs can be seen to have varying numbers of stages in their structures. For example, _through_ has the following stage structure, where the interval [0,1] corresponds to the path in its entirety:

<p style="margin-left:3em">(14)</p>
<p style="margin-left:6em">through x</p>
<p style="margin-left:6em">- - - - - + + + + + + - - - - -</p>
<p style="margin-left:6em">0                                     1</p>
<p style="margin-left:3em">(2011:97)</p>


The plusses and minuses indicate different stages, showing that _through_ has a three-part stage structure. All telic DirPs minimally have a two-part stage structure, since there is a change of state once the telos is reached. And, it is this analysis that explains the empirical generalizations initially noted in this chapter. Specifically, since atelic verbs do not entail a change of state&mdash;in fact, they necessitate a lack of change of state&mdash;they cannot combine with _get_, since _get_ is inherently indicative of a change in state (because of the presence of cause in its denotation); as such, anomaly results.[^14]<sup>,</sup>[^15]

With regard to _at_, Brownlow argues that there are two flavors of _at_, a LocP flavor and a DirP flavor. The explanation for _at_, when it is a DirP, is similar to the foregoing explanation for the atelic DirPs&mdash;namely, the preposition only consists of a single-part stage structure (112). The attempt to explain the incompatibility of _at_ as a LocP with _get_ is notably lacking. An appeal to axial parts of prepositions is made (_cf_. Svenonius 2006), but not much more than the following is said: "_get_, for whatever reason, needs to locate the subject of the SC [small clause—_i.e._, PredP] with respect to an axial part of the prepositional object, and locative _at_, because it does not operate on axial parts, is ungrammatical with _get_ for this reason" (114).

##### Chapter 5

Now, in chapter 5, Brownlow considers passive complementation of _get_. Again, there is some terminological ground to briefly review. Following Kratzer (2001) and Embick (2004), Brownlow distinguishes between three types of participial-like complementation, summarized in (15):

<p style="margin-left:3em">(15) <img style="vertical-align:text-top;"src="http://i.imgur.com/PrqTd46.jpg" alt="brownlow2011-participialcomplementation" /></p>
<p style="margin-left:3em">(Brownlow 2011:170)</p>

Brownlow argues that _get_ can take either resultative adjective or passive participle complementation, though not stative adjective complementation, as the stative nature of such complementation leads to anomaly, given the presence of cause in the denotation of _get_.[^16]

Now, before considering each type of passive complementation in detail, Brownlow goes through the standard demonstration that passive complementation project Voice and Cause separately using tests for agentivity and the presence of Cause  (174-179).

After these tests, Brownlow considers the passive participle complementation of _get_ first. He motivates the claim that _get_ passives can take passive participle complementation based on the fact that normal passive participle sentences contain implicit Agents that can be specified with a _by_-phrase, as is the case in (16).

<p style="margin-left:3em">(16) Mary got John arrested (by the police)</p>
<p style="margin-left:3em">(2011:180)</p>

He also motivates the ability to take such complementation on the basis of five agent-oriented tests:

<p style="margin-left:3em">(17)</p>
<p style="margin-left:6em">a. The ship got sunk with an explosive device</p>
<p style="margin-left:6em">b. The ship got intentionally sunk</p>
<p style="margin-left:6em">c. The ship got sunk PRO to collect the insurance payout</p>
<p style="margin-left:6em">d. The ship got sunk by the enemy captain</p>
<p style="margin-left:6em">e. The ship got sunk on purpose</p>
<p style="margin-left:3em">(2011:182)</p>

It is worth nothing that the judgments reported in Brownlow (2011) actually disagree with previous judgments reported in the literature. Specifically, Alexiadou (2005), following Fox & Grodzinsky (1998), judges (17c) and (17e) as ungrammatical.[^17] Nonetheless, the motivation for passive complementation in (16) seems plausible, and, at any rate, this post is largely intended to be a summary, not a critical engagement. Thus, I turn to the analysis.

With regard to the analysis thereof, there are a few moving parts to the analysis of the _get_ passive: (i) a second IndentN projection[^18] and (ii) the following denotation for the passive morpheme, where Δ is a spatiotemporal interval and ximp is some implied Agent of the event who may be specified with a _by_-phrase:[^19]

<p style="margin-left:3em">(18) ⟦-edPass-v⟧ = λf<s,t>.λΔπ.[there is an event e and an individual ximp such that f(e) & holds(e,Δ) & Agent(e,ximp)]</p>
<p style="margin-left:3em">(2011:186)</p>

This second posited IndentN projection has the same denotation as the first&mdash;namely, 'λx.x'. However, it is different from the first IndentN in that it is obligatorily phonologically null, whereas the first is lexicalized by _-self_. Brownlow says that this is relatively intuitive insofar as this latter IdentN is not in a case-marked position (_cf_. Burzio's Generalization (1986)), whereas the former is.

This IdentN projection does similar work as the first IdentN projection insofar as it obviates any concerns about a DP receiving multiple Θ-roles, since IdentNP can stay low in the structure and the DP that merges with it instead raises to receive the second Θ-role, as in (19).[^20]

<p style="margin-left:3em">(19) <img style="vertical-align:text-top;"src="http://i.imgur.com/wKlegtW.jpg" alt="brownlow2011-passive" /> </p>
<p style="margin-left:3em">(Brownlow 2011:187)</p>

(19) accounts for normal _be _passives, says Brownlow (187); however, in order to account for _get_ passives, particularly those of either the agentive A-type or those B-type _get_ passives with reflexives, Brownlow hypothesizes that another IdentN projects, as the DP needs to move another time, out of spec,PredP and into spec,<i>v</i>P. Without another IdentN projection, the Θ-role problem would arise again. Thus, the low part of the PredP projection actually looks as it does in (20) for _get_ passives.

<p style="margin-left:3em">(20) <img style="vertical-align:text-top;"src="http://i.imgur.com/UEHcMaj.jpg" alt="brownlow2011-passive2" /> </p>
<p style="margin-left:3em">(Brownlow 2011:188)</p>

Then, for example, the derivation of a B-type _get_ passive with a reflexive looks as follows:[^21]

<p style="margin-left:3em">(21) <img style="vertical-align:text-top;"src="http://i.imgur.com/wWGGBWY.jpg" alt="brownlow2011-passive3" /> </p>
<p style="margin-left:3em">(Brownlow 2011:190)</p>

Next, Brownlow provides evidence for the ability of _get_ to combine with resultative adjectives. The evidence for this is the following:

<p style="margin-left:3em">(22)</p>
<p style="margin-left:6em">a. John is washed</p>
<p style="margin-left:6em">b. John was washed</p>
<p style="margin-left:6em">c. John got washed</p>
<p style="margin-left:6em">d. Mary got John washed</p>
<p style="margin-left:3em">(adapted from Brownlow 2011:191)</p>

The important point is the following: (22a)&mdash;which is an instance of a resultative adjective&mdash;, (22c), and (22d) are compatible with a reflexive-like interpretation where John is the one who washes himself, whereas (22b)&mdash;which is an instance of the verbal passive participle&mdash;is **not** compatible with such an interpretation (note that this reading **cannot** be forced even if you try to do so by adding a PP whose complement is co-indexed with <i>John<sub>i</sub></i> such as <i>by him<sub>i</sub></i> or <i>by himself<sub>i</sub></i> to (22b)). Thus, Brownlow reasons that _get_ must also be compatible with the resultative adjective.

The analysis of this construction is as follows. Brownlow follows Kratzer (2001) in treating the resultative adjective as having a perfective aspect to it; he gives the participle the following denotation:[^22]

<p style="margin-left:3em">(23) ⟦-edRes⟧ = λf<s,t>.λtπ.[there is an event e such that holds(e,T) & f(e) & T < t]</p>
<p style="margin-left:3em">(2011:193)</p>

A ResP is then built up, analogous to Pass-vP, except that it is built around _-edRes_ instead of _-edPass-v_. ResP is then merged with Pred, and the derivation proceeds as normal.[^23] (24) and (25) show the derivation.

<p style="margin-left:3em">(24) <img style="vertical-align:text-top;"src="http://i.imgur.com/uusMLTj.jpg" alt="brownlow2011-resp" /> </p>
<p style="margin-left:3em">(Brownlow 2011:194)</p>
<p style="margin-left:3em">(25) <img style="vertical-align:text-top;"src="http://i.imgur.com/3dW6JkE.jpg" alt="brownlow2011-adjresderivation" /></p>
<p style="margin-left:3em">(Brownlow 2011:195)</p>

##### Chapter 4

In this chapter, Brownlow considers sentences such as those in (26); specifically, he argues that (26a) has the same structure as (26b), the difference simply arising from the fact that _himself_, in these constructions, meets the condition for anaphoric drop (123-128).

<p style="margin-left:3em">(26)</p>
<p style="margin-left:6em">a. John got dry</p>
<p style="margin-left:6em">b. John got himself dry</p>
<p style="margin-left:3em">(2011:164-165)</p>

The motivation for making this argument, as mentioned above, stems from the fact that (26a) is ambiguous between an agentive reading and a non-agentive reading (though the agentive reading is preferred when the subject of the sentence is animate). This is problematic for Brownlow's claim that _get_ does **not** bundle Voice and Cause in the syntax, since Voice assigns the Agent Θ-role. So, plausibly, Voice and Cause might actually be bundled in constructions such as those in (26a).

The argument that Brownlow makes to avoid this objection is as follows. Following Kayne (2002) and Zwart (2002)&mdash;and building on Kratzer (2009)&mdash;Brownlow develops a theory of reflexive pronouns where _-self _is the head of a projection called IdentNP, whose semantics are 'λx.x' as mentioned above. This merges with the DP _John_, as in (27), which then raises to spec,<i>v</i>P. Moreover, _him_ is spelled out as the trace of _John_, which is necessary because _-self_ must be bound in such a position.[^24] The story for the non-reflexive version is the exact same. Brownlow argues that _himself_ meets the conditions for Anaphoric Object Drop, a phenomenon exhibited in similar syntactic positions (123-128). Thus, the structure for the non-reflexive version is as in (28).

<p style="margin-left:3em">(27) <img style="vertical-align:text-top;"src="http://i.imgur.com/HcJGMdo.jpg" alt="brownlow2011-agentivereflex" /></p>
<p style="margin-left:3em">(Brownlow 2011:164)</p>
<p style="margin-left:3em">(28) <img style="vertical-align:text-top;"src="http://i.imgur.com/4TZ3B5s.jpg" alt="brownlow2011-agentivenoreflex" /></p>
<p style="margin-left:3em">(Brownlow 2011:165)</p>

If these structures are correct, then the argument can be maintained that Voice and Cause are bundled separately, even in the agentive A-type constructions, such as (26a).[^25]

#### Notes

[^1]: In the case that fonts are not rendering correctly:

      ![brownlow2011-get-denotation](http://i.imgur.com/DJ5E9mn.jpg)
	
[^2]: See pp. 13-15 for Brownlow's (syntactic and) semantic assumptions. Type s is a type for eventualities that cover both states and events&mdash;the variable for which is e&mdash;following Bach (1986). Also, the Event Identification rule of Kratzer (1996:122) plays a crucial role in Brownlow's analysis.

[^3]: I'm actually not sure if Voice is supposed to be interchangeable with accusative little _v_ or little _v_ in general; Brownlow says that he uses Voice interchangeably with little _v_ in general (2011:14, fn. 6), yet I was under the impression that Voice assigned an Agent Θ-role, which would make it only (analogous to) accusative little _v_, not little _v_ in general. In fact, taking Voice to be accusative little _v_ only is actually supported by a schematic tree in Brownlow's dissertation itself (17, ex. 32), even though he overtly eschews such usage. As such, I'll stick with this usage, even though it goes against Brownlow's overt comments about Voice. Of course, perhaps there are two Voice heads and it is simply a different name for little _v_. It doesn't matter that much, as long as terminology is clear; hence, the reason for this note&mdash;specifically, in this particular post, I use Voice interchangeably with accusative little _v_ only.
	
[^4]: Pylkkänen (2008) shows that Japanese adversity causatives and Finnish desiderative causatives can project Voice and Cause independently of one another (see Brownlow 2011:18-23 for an overview of her arguments to this effect). Thus, effectively, Brownlow's thesis adds another language to the list of those that can project these heads independently in the syntax.
	
[^5]: Thus, Brownlow's claim that English can project Voice and Cause separately is minimally successful to the extent that his argument for this denotation of _get_ is successful, since there is at least one clearcut case&mdash;namely, B-type constructions&mdash;of independent projection. Nonetheless, Brownlow is of course concerned with showing that this phenomenon is uniform, since the extent to which it can be shown to be uniform is part and parcel of what underwrites the argument for the denotation itself.

[^6]: Roughly, this amounts to being able to either merge accusative little _v_&mdash;_i.e._, Voice&mdash;or unaccusative little _v_ next in the derivation in (i): 

      ![brownlow2011-johngotangry](http://i.imgur.com/OjPX5Ze.jpg)

      (Brownlow 2011:65)

      Though, strictly speaking, the derivation for an agentive A-type construction is a little different, as Brownlow argues for the presence of an IdentNP projection in these constructions, which addresses the potential objection that Voice and Cause are bundled in these constructions (164).

[^7]: The _get_ constructions that are not considered in the dissertation include those with DP complements, those with VP complements, and idiomatic usages of _get_, among others (2011:15-16). The analysis limits itself to AP complements (chapter 2), PP complements (chapter 3), reflexive (or anaphoric) complements (chapter 4), and passive complements (chapter 5).
	
[^8]: Though, of course, see Hornstein (1999) for a Minimalist view which allows multiple Θ-role assignment to the same DP.
	
[^9]: This argument turns on an analysis of _-self_ that I'm not sure that I buy; more on this below, particularly note 25.

[^11]: I think this is actually really cool; however, there does seem to be perhaps one reason for concern&mdash;specifically, it is not transparent how to construe the _holds_ relation (in an ontological sense), since it can take a property and either an eventuality (as in (8)) or an individual (as in (9)) as arguments. Nonetheless, the analysis still seems to have a lot of merit, and it's not immediately clear what the problem with the analysis is other than a lack of clarity about what exactly this _holds_ relation is.
	
[^12]: Brownlow also has an account of _get_ constructions involving comparative and superlative complementation, which I've omitted a summary of here for the sake of (relative) brevity; see pp. 53-64 for the details.
	
[^13]: One thing that I do not understand about this analysis is how the spatial argument, i, gets saturated. At the level of LocPP there's still one more lambda conversion waiting to happen, and, as the derivation proceeds, nothing saturates this argument, as far as I can tell.
	
[^14]: As such, the judgment in (12c) should be '#' and not '*'; however, I've simply taken the example exactly as it was in Brownlow (2011). Nobody seems to be careful about this distinction... Sigh.
	
[^15]: I still have the same problem with this analysis as I had with the analysis of LocP complementation of _get_ noted in note 13&mdash;namely, I'm not sure how the extant i argument gets saturated (see Brownlow 2011:111, ex. 149).
	
[^16]: This analysis goes against previous analyses of the _get_ passive: "Fox and Grodzinsky (1998), Taranto (2004) and Alexiadou (2005) argue for an analysis with resultative adjectival complementation, while Haegeman (1985) and Butler and Tsoulas (2006) argue in favour of verbal [_i.e._, passive participle] complementation" (Brownlow 2011:170).
	
[^17]: For the record, I think my judgments are as follows, though I'm having a particularly hard time forming a judgment about (17c) for some reason:

    1. {: style="list-style-type:none;"} (17)
        1. {:.footnote-level-two-example} The ship got sunk with an explosive device        
        1. {:.footnote-level-two-example} *The ship got intentionally sunk
        1. {:.footnote-level-two-example} ?/*The ship got sunk PRO to collect the insurance payout
        1. {:.footnote-level-two-example} The ship got sunk by the enemy captain
        1. {:.footnote-level-two-example} *The ship got sunk on purpose
  	
[^18]: The first IdentN projection was briefly mentioned in note 6 and will be discussed in more detail below in the chapter 4 section.

[^20]: On this analysis, I have the same concern that I had with the analysis of the prepositional complementation of _get_&mdash;namely, I am not sure how the unsaturated argument of the property that Pred takes in its complement gets saturated higher in the structure (_cf_. notes 13 and 15). Am I just missing something? Does the lambda not need to undergo lambda conversion for interpretability? I can't figure it out. To save myself another note in an already lengthy post, the same concern is going to arise again briefly in the analysis of the resultative adjective complementation.
	
[^21]: For the agentive A-type passive without the reflexive, it is assumed that the IdentNP in spec,PredP is the phonologically null version and not the version that is lexicalized by _-self_.

[^23]: Up until this point, all of the posts in this series have largely been summaries that do not critically engage with the material. I intend to largely keep this series that way, as I mean these posts to be mainly for my purposes as an aid in remembering arguments from papers that I've read (this is not to say that I might not start another, more critically engaging series of posts at some point). That being said, at the present, I will digress a bit and critically engage with this analysis of the passive, as it is particularly pertinent to the research that I am doing at the moment, and I have a few issues with this analysis. Both issues that I will pinpoint here turn on _be_ passives and not _get_ passives, yet they are issues with the analysis of the _be_ passive in Brownlow (2011), which is the basis for his analysis of the _get_ passive. First, I'm not sure that I like the IdentN projection as part of the passive analysis. Admittedly, it does obviate the need to stipulate the conditions of the Binding Theory and actually derives them (more on this below), which is cool; however, porting this projection over into the analysis of the passive actually gives rise to a problem. True _be_ passives are not supposed to compatible with reflexive interpretation (_cf_. (22b)), yet the only way that this follows on Brownlow's analysis is by stipulating that ximp is disjoint with the referent that is assigned the Θ-role of Holder, or whatever exactly _Holder_ is (interestingly, the fact that this disjoint reference must be derived somehow might be support for Collins's (2005) "smuggling" analysis of the passive). A second problem I have with this analysis is that it does not derive the interpretation of the purpose clause test (another point in favor of Collins (2005))&mdash;specifically, there is no straightforward way to predict the fact that the only interpretation available for PRO in (i) is one in which PRO is co-referent with the external argument, _even when that external argument is not overtly specified by a_ by_-phrase_:

       1. {:.footnote-level-one-example} The ship was burned (by its owner<sub>i</sub>) [PRO<sub>i</sub> to collect the insurance money]

       Indeed, I think one cannot even try to force the context. Let me try. Imagine some wealthy bourgeois white-collar criminal opportunist that hires an arson to burn his boat so that he may collect the insurance money. In this context, I do not think one can utter (ii) or even (iii), at least not if the speaker knows that the actual arsonist is a different person than the one collecting the insurance money; (iii) seems acceptable if the speaker does not know this fact (if this is true, and particularly if a theory of control involves c-command, then this would seem to be strong support for Collins's (2005) analysis of the passive):

       1. {:.footnote-level-one-example  style="visibility:hidden; position:absolute;"} &nbsp;

       1. {:.footnote-level-one-example} */# The ship was burned by the arsonist<sub>i</sub> [PRO<sub>j</sub> to collect the insurance money]

       1. {:.footnote-level-one-example} */# The ship was burned [PRO<sub>j</sub> to collect the insurance money]

       Maybe the judgment of (iii) is a bit questionable. Nonetheless, at the very least, it seems to be problematic for Brownlow's analysis of the _be_ passive which informs his analysis of the _get_ passive, as the interpretations of (i) and (ii) (and (iii)) do not follow except by stipulation.
	
[^24]: One cool thing about this analysis (mentioned above), is that **if** it is correct, it obviates the need to stipulate the conditions of the Binding Theory, as it actually derives the conditions; see p. 152 for the details.
	
[^25]: Again, I'll briefly engage in mounting some passing criticism of this argument in two ways. First, I'll briefly question the motivation for the IdentNP projection. A major motivating factor in positing the IdentN projection is its ability to unify an analysis of _-self_ across its various distributions, such as those in (i).

    1. {:.footnote-level-one-example}
        1. {:.footnote-level-two-example} John mutilates himself
        2. {:.footnote-level-two-example} John self-mutilated

           (2011:144)

    Brownlow argues that these constructions are the same, except that IdentN has raised and attached to the verb in (ib). However, it seems much more likely, in my estimation, that verbs like _self-mutilate_ are lexicalized. Otherwise, it's not immediately clear why their distribution is so limited, as one would expect any verb that can take a reflexive complement to be capable of raising IdentN to attach to the verb, yet this is not the case:

    1. {:.footnote-level-one-example style="visibility:hidden; position:absolute;"}

    1. {:.footnote-level-one-example}
        1. {:.footnote-level-two-example} *John self-saw
        2. {:.footnote-level-two-example} *John self-shaved
        2. {:.footnote-level-two-example} *John self-punched

    Brownlow mentions this in passing, but does not have much to say about it (155). Of course, to the extent that the other motivating arguments for the IdentN projection are successful, this might simply mean that cases like _self-mutilate_ are not to be unified by some unified analysis of _-self_. So, briefly, another motivating factor in this analysis is its ability to handle proxy readings (122-123), where sentences like (ia) can have the interpretation where John mutilated a wax figure of himself. Brownlow accounts for these readings by positing a Proxy head in the syntax, whose semantics are 'λx.λy.[x:x is a suitable proxy for y]' (153-154). Pre-theoretically, this seems very implausible; it seems much more likely that such readings are handled pragmatically and not semantically. At any rate, there are yet other motivating factors for this analysis (see pp. 128-150), so the analysis might still stand on its own. Thus, a second passing criticism of this analysis is that an accompanying theory of traces and Spell Out is lacking. That is to say, other than drawing the analogy between these constructions and other Anaphoric Object Drop constructions, Brownlow does not provide an analysis of why the drop is licensed. Thus, even though the structures are analogous, an actual analysis might still turn up relevant differences between the different types of constructions. Moreover, if traces can be spelled out, it's not immediately clear why (iii) is unacceptable, particularly given the second posited IdentN head, which is phonologically null.
