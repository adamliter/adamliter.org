Here's a [link to documentation][SemDocumentation] for LaTeX macros that I&mdash;with the help of Alan Munn's [answer on TeX.SX][AlanAnswer]&mdash;have written in order to make the typesetting of semantic denotations and computations both easier and more readable.[^1] Suggestions and improvements are more than welcome.

#### Notes

[^1]: I have provided a link to a PDF rather than writing the macros themselves directly into this blog post, as I suspect the macros will evolve over time; this way, then, I can simply update the PDF, and this blog post will always contain the most recent macros that I have written for typesetting semantics.
