# teaching

For past teaching and TAing that I did as an academic, see below.

I also enjoy sharing the knowledge I've learned when it comes to computers and
all things programming related. I've put together [materials for a LaTeX
workshop][latex-ling], loosely aimed at linguists, which I've taught several
times. I've also put together [materials for a `git` workshop][git-workshop],
loosely aimed at scientists who do human subjects research, which I've taught
once over the course of 7 weeks.
