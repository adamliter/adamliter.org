#### Claim

The cognitive operation that licenses passivization is acquired late, whatever it may be. Moreover, it is not related to the _by_-phrase, as is suggested in Fox & Grodzinsky (1998).

#### Arguments

There are generally two lines of argument in this paper: (i) a rebuttal of Fox & Grodzinsky's (1998) claims about the passive and the _by_-phrase (Hirsch & Wexler 2006a:253-259); and (ii) a positive account for a maturational theory of passive acquisition (259-260). I shall start by presenting an overview of the latter.

##### Maturational Theory Argument

The authors make, roughly, four interrelated points that support this claim:
	
  1. Hirsch & Wexler note that all passive studies reporting early acquisition are solely based on natural production and not comprehension data (250). They point out that Crawford (2005) offers strong evidence for universal passive delay and that, for every language where acquisition studies of the passive have been done&mdash;German: Bartke (2004); Dutch: Verrips (1996); Spanish: Pierce (1992); Brazilian Portuguese: Gabriel (2001); Russian: Babyonshev & Brun (2003); Serbian: Djurkovic (2007); Greek: Terzi & Wexler (2002); Japanse: Sugisaki (1998); and Mandarin Chinese: Chang (1986)&mdash;, children exhibit difficulties with the passive (Hirsch & Wexler 2006a:251,259)

  2. Terzi & Wexler (2002) show that in Greek&mdash;where adjectival and verbal passives are not homophonous&mdash;children also perform at chance on actional passives at the age of 5 (Hirsch & Wexler 2006a:259). The implicit reasoning in this point is that the strategy of analyzing actional passives as adjectival is not available here. So, we would expect young children to perform poorly on **all** passives&mdash;not just psychological passives, which are not easily analyzed as adjectives&mdash;if there truly is a universal passive delay.
	
  3. Ganger, Dunn, & Gordon (2005) report a twin study where identical twins raised in different environments score more similarly than do fraternal twins on psychological passives.
	
  4. And, finally, there is a sudden and uniform onset of comprehension of psychological passives across children that occurs around 6.5 years, as reported in Hirsch & Wexler (2006b).

Thus, Hirsch & Wexler (2006a) conclude that whatever it is that underlies passive acquisition is something that matures.

##### Rebutting Fox & Grodzinsky (1998)

First, Hirsch & Wexler rightly note that the account in Fox & Grodzinsky (1998) relies on the assumption that children know that _by_ may directly assign an Agent Θ-role to its complement (2006a:253). They then go on to argue that children do not know this. First, they offer evidence from a CHILDES search (MacWhinney 2000), where no instances of nominal _by_-phrases (those types of _by_-phrases that are most likely to have an Agentive complement) in either child-produced or child-directed speech.[^1]

Next, they present evidence from a study that investigated the comprehension of _by_ vs. _about_ in children from ages 3;0 to 5;10. Children were given a forced-choice truth value judgment task, where they were asked something like "the story about/by Minnie had mountains in it" when presented with two possible pictures. Hirsch & Wexler observe that all children performed significantly below chance on the _by_ trials, indicating that they were interpreting _by_ as a Theme assigner, just like _about_ (254-257).[^2]

Finally, they argue against a premise that was integral to the account in Fox & Grodzinsky (1998)&mdash;namely, they argue that children do not actually comprehend truncated psychological passives (257-259). They note that Gordon & Chafetz (1990) found this to be the case, as did Hirsch & Wexler (2006b;c).

They take the empirical evidence to be overwhelming that children perform at chance on both truncated psychological passives and non-truncated psychological passives; they thus conclude that any theory attributing the issues of passive acquisition to the _by_-phrase is incorrect (2006a:258).

#### Notes

[^1]: It is worth explicitly noting that they only looked for _by_-phrases attached to NPs. Moreover, as they themselves note "[c]orpus counts alone are limiting, as paucity of input or productions does not necessitate poverty of comprehension" (2006a:254).
	
[^2]: Two points. First, I'm not sure that it makes sense to say that they're interpreting _by_ as _about_, since their performance on _about_ trials is around 90%, whereas their performance for _by_ trials ranges from 20-35%. If they were really interpreting it as _about_, it seems more reasonable to expect around 10% performance on the _by_ trials, in line with their performance on _about_ trials. This claim actually can be asked, statistically, with a regression, but a _t_-test that tests for chance performance does **not** license the inference that they are treating _by_ as _about_. Of course, this does not bear on whether they actually know that _by_ can assign an Agent Θ-role. So, second, it seems that they could have tested other constructions in addition to nominals where _by_ does assign an Agent Θ-role. It might be the case that children just have trouble with _by_ adjoining to an NP, or something like that.
