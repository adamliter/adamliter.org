#### Claim

Salustri & Hyams argue for the Imperative Analogue Hypothesis, which holds that the imperative form in pro-drop languages is analogous to Root Infinitives (RI) in non-pro-drop languages.<sup>1</sup> Furthermore, they also claim that what is universal about this stage in acquisition "is the mapping of irrealis mood onto a tenseless clausal structure" (2006:160).

#### Argument

The argument that is to be summarized here will be for the first part of the claim in Salustri & Hyams (2006). The second claim will be considered in the section below, called 'The Universal Core', as the paper itself is primarily dedicated to the first claim.

Salustri & Hyams claim that the Imperative Analogue Hypothesis makes two predictions:

<p style="margin-left:3em">(1) Predictions of the [Imperative Analogue Hypothesis]</p>
<p style="margin-left:6em">a. In null subject languages imperatives will occur significantly more often in child language than in adult language.</p>
<p style="margin-left:6em">b. In child language imperatives will occur significantly more often in the null subject languages than in the RI languages.</p>
<p style="margin-left:3em">(2006:162)</p>

The first prediction follows from the hypothesis because RIs eventually trade-off with modal constructions, as the child's language develops (see Blom 2003 for the Dutch data); thus, one would expect imperatives to decrease and trade-off with modals, too, if they are analogous (162).

The second prediction follows because, if RIs and imperatives both express an irrealis mood, _i.e._, if they are analogous, then one would expect RIs to bleed imperatives in non-pro-drop languages (162).

Salustri & Hyams then procede to show that these predictions are, in fact, empirically borne out. Specifically, pro-drop languages such as Italian (162-168), Spanish, Catalan (168-170), Hungarian, and Slovenian (170-171) all exhibit significantly more use of the imperative in child language than in adult language. And, moreover, in non-pro-drop languages such as German (162-168), Dutch, and Icelandic (168), child language imperatives occur significantly less than in the pro-drop languages considered in the paper.

#### Objections

Then, Salustri & Hyams go on to consider two possible alternative theories that would purportedly explain the data they examine, one is that the third person singular indicative form is the default form for children and the other is that the imperative form is an underspecified form (171).

As responses to these possible alternatives, they offer several counterexamples to the empirical predictions that these alternative theories would make.<sup>2</sup>

#### 'The Universal Core'

Finally, Salustri & Hyams advance the claim that the similarity underwriting the analogousness between these two forms is the irrealis mood.<sup>3</sup> Specifically, they assume that both RI and imperatives check an irrealis feature and that RIs are more economical to construct in that imperatives involve verb movement to the left periphery and RIs do not. Moreover, RIs are blocked in pro-drop languages because they have Agr features that must be checked. Thus, when the more economical form&mdash;the RI&mdash;is available, children use that form to express the irrealis mood; if it is not available because of economy considerations, then they use the imperative form (177).<sup>4</sup>

#### Notes
	
  1. For a succinct overview of what is exactly entailed by RIs, see this [handout](http://ling-blogs.bu.edu/lx500a1s10/files/2010/01/lx500acqs10-02b-nrfs-handout.pdf) from Paul Hagstrom.

  2. See pp. 171-175 for the details.

  3. They reject the claim in van Kampen (2004) that the difference stems from frequencies in the children's inputs; see (Salustri & Hyams 2006:176-177).

  4. Note that, on the reading of this paper articulated here, the claim that "the universal core of the RI stage is the mapping of irrealis mood onto a tenseless structure" (2006:178) is actually slightly misleading in terms of causality. The universal core is just the irrealis mood. The tenselessness of these structures follows from the economy considerations because pro-drop languages "have (abstract) Agr features that must be checked [and the] specification of Agr entails the specification of Tense" (177). That is to say, RIs happen to be tenseless in non-pro-drop languages (for whatever reason) and imperatives happen to be tenseless in pro-drop languages because the tensed irrealis form is _ruled out by economy considerations_. This reading, I think, is justified by their explicit invocation of economy considerations (177). Moreover, this point of clarification does not seem particularly important and does not impact the argument that they actually make.
