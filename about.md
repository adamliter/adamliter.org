## About Me
					
In a <del>nutshell</del> bulleted list of no particular order:

- Language
- Philosophy
- Activism
- Coffee
- Em dashes

And now in some brief, expository paragraphs:
			
I grew up in occupied Dakota territory, or just outside of Minneapolis, Minnesota. For the last four years, I have been living in occupied Anishinaabe territory, attending Michigan State University.

I have a B.A. in linguistics and a B.A. in philosophy from Michigan State; I'm currently pursuing an M.A. in linguistics, also at Michigan State. For more about my academic work, see my [academic page][academic].
					
My senior year of high school was when I began organizing, though my experiences and the relationships that I made in my undergraduate years were most formative for my views on politics, organizing, and anti-oppressive praxis. (Though these views are still growing and evolving and will hopefully always be growing and evolving.)

Currently, I'm working with a nascent collective called the [Dis-orientation Collective][DOC]. Check it out, and get involved if you're interested!
					
I *really* like coffee. I worked as a barista, off-and-on, for a few years at the [Dunn Bros at the Smith Douglas More House][DB].
					
And I also really fucking like em dashes&#8212;I probably use them too much in my writing&#8212;, I think, because they're the best tool for approximating how I tend to speak (*i.e.*, non-linearly):
					
<blockquote>
The em dash, m dash, m-rule, or "mutton" (&#8212;) often demarcates a break of thought or some similar interpolation stronger than the interpolation demarcated by parentheses &#8211; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dash#Em_dash">Wikipedia</a>
</blockquote>
					
As a result, there are a lot of typographical splotches in my writing that look like '&#8212;,'. I actually think this looks kinda cool. Sorry grammatical and typographical purists.
